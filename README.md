# Blockchain-Wallets-Challenge

## Background
As the lead developer at KryptoJobs2Go, a cutting-edge startup revolutionizing the fintech industry, I'm tasked with integrating Ethereum blockchain technology into our platform. Our goal is to empower customers to seamlessly pay fintech professionals using cryptocurrency.

In pursuit of this objective, I've created the fintech_finder.py file, which forms the backbone of our web interface. This file, designed to be compatible with the Streamlit library, enables users to interact with our platform effortlessly.

Moreover, to ensure the smooth integration of blockchain functionality, I've leveraged the crypto_wallet.py script, which facilitates Ethereum transactions within our application.

Through this integration, users can swiftly locate fintech professionals, hire them, and execute payments instantaneously using cryptocurrency. This innovative approach not only enhances user experience but also positions KryptoJobs2Go at the forefront of the fintech industry's digital transformation.
